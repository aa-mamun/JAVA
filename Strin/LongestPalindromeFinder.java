 /*
 The key point here is that from the mid of any palindrome, if we go to right and left by 1 place, 
itâ€™s always same character. For example 12321, here mid is 3 and if we keep moving one position in both sides, 
we get 2 and then 1.We will use the same logic in our java program to find out the longest palindrome.
However if the palindrome length is even, the mid size is also even, so we need to make sure in our program 
that this is also checked, for example 12333321, here mid is 33 and if we keep moving one position in both sides,
we get 3, 2 and 1.

In our java program, we will iterate over the input string with mid as 1st place and checking the 
right and left character. We will have two global variables to save the start and end position for
palindrome. We also need to check if there is already a longer palindrome found since there can we 
multiple palindrome in the given string.
